# Overview
In this repository I am making 3 mini-projects/demos using the Typescript language. Here is a description of the demo along with principles that they will follow:

1. **Car listing repo** - Display output to terminal, Async functions, Classes, Lists
Fetches data from a car dataset, organizes it into a class and displays it in the user terminal

2. **Recursive substring finder** - Recursion, Lists
Compares two different strings (abcxyz, hjkabc) and finds the common substring (abc)

3. **Error throw clicker** - Throwing and handling exceptions, Jest
A simple web page populated with error buttons, clicking on a specific error button activates a specific error and a way to resolve it. Jest will be used to confirm everything resolves correctly

My purpose for creating these mini-demos is to learn more about the Typescript language. I've really enjoyed writing things in Typescript and I know that it leads to less bugs/defects within code. 

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a one minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code.}
